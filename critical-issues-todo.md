# Critical Issues to Fix

## Issue 1: Images Disappear
- **Problem**: When adding a second image, the first one disappears. Then both disappear while editing.
- **Root Cause**: Likely the `setContent(editor.innerHTML)` is causing re-renders that lose images
- **Priority**: HIGH

## Issue 2: Canvas Too Narrow
- **Problem**: The editor canvas is too narrow for comfortable editing
- **Solution**: Increase the width of the contentEditable div
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

## Issue 3: Raw HTML Displayed Instead of Rendered Content
- **Problem**: Blog posts display raw HTML code instead of formatted content
- **Root Cause**: The content is being displayed as text instead of being rendered as HTML
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - This breaks the entire blog functionality
- **Visible in screenshot**: Shows raw `<br>`, `<p>`, `<span>` tags instead of formatted text

## Fix Order
1. Fix Issue 3 (raw HTML display) - CRITICAL
2. Fix Issue 1 (images disappearing) - HIGH  
3. Fix Issue 2 (canvas width) - MEDIUM
