# Xano Data Mapping Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
The `createBlogPost` and `updateBlogPost` functions in `src/services/xanoService.js` had inconsistent data structures, causing blog post save operations to fail.

## Root Cause
**Before the fix:**

### createBlogPost was sending:
```javascript
const assetData = {
  title: postData.title || 'Untitled Blog Post',
  description: postData.content || '',
  original_creation_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
};
```

### updateBlogPost was sending:
```javascript
const assetData = {
  title: postData.title,
  description: postData.content,
  submitted_by: postData.author || 'Blog Editor',
  tags: postData.tags || '',
  is_featured: postData.featured || false,
};
```

The mismatch meant that the Xano backend (configured to work with an "asset" table) wasn't receiving all required fields during creation.

## Solution Applied
**After the fix:**

### createBlogPost now sends (unified structure):
```javascript
const assetData = {
  title: postData.title || 'Untitled Blog Post',
  description: postData.content || '',
  submitted_by: postData.author || 'Blog Editor',
  tags: postData.tags || '',
  is_featured: postData.featured || false,
  original_creation_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
};
```

## Changes Made
1. ✅ Added `submitted_by` field to createBlogPost
2. ✅ Added `tags` field to createBlogPost  
3. ✅ Added `is_featured` field to createBlogPost
4. ✅ Updated code comment to reflect corrected data mapping
5. ✅ Maintained `original_creation_date` field (only used in create)

## Benefits
- **Data Consistency**: Both create and update operations now send the same core fields
- **Xano Compatibility**: Matches the expected asset table structure
- **Reliability**: Blog posts will save correctly with all required fields
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and maintain consistent data flow

## Pull Request
- **Branch**: `fix/xano-data-mapping`
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/dmccolly/social-engagement-hub/pull/13
- **Status**: Ready for review and merge

## Testing Recommendations
After merging, verify:
1. New blog posts can be created successfully
2. All fields (title, description, author, tags, featured status) are saved correctly
3. Existing blog posts can still be updated
4. No breaking changes to the blog functionality

## Files Modified
- `src/services/xanoService.js` - Updated createBlogPost function

## Next Steps
1. Review and merge the pull request
2. Test blog post creation in the application
3. Verify data is correctly saved to Xano backend
4. Monitor for any related issues
