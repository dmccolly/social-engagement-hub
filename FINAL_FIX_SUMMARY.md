# Final Fix Summary - Image Click Handler

## Issue Discovered
After implementing the drag-to-resize functionality (PR #3), images were still not clickable. No handles or toolbar appeared when clicking on images in the editor.

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem was a fundamental issue with how event handlers were being attached:

1. **Direct onclick handlers** were attached to images during insertion
2. After insertion, `setContent(editor.innerHTML)` was called to update React state
3. This caused the contentEditable div to re-render its innerHTML
4. **Re-rendering removed all event listeners** from the DOM elements
5. Images became unclickable

### Why This Happened
When you set `innerHTML` on a DOM element, it completely replaces the content with a new HTML string. Any event listeners attached to the old elements are lost because new elements are created from the HTML string.

## Solution: Event Delegation
Instead of attaching event handlers directly to images, we use **event delegation**:

1. Attach a single click listener to the editor container (parent element)
2. When a click occurs anywhere in the editor, check if the target is an image
3. If it's an image with our ID format, extract the ID and call selectImage()

### Code Changes

**Before (Broken)**:
```javascript
// In insertImageIntoContent
img.onclick = function(e) {
  selectImage(imageId);
};
// Lost when setContent() updates innerHTML
```

**After (Working)**:
```javascript
// In useEffect - runs once and persists
useEffect(() => {
  const editor = contentRef.current;
  
  const handleImageClick = (e) => {
    if (e.target.tagName === 'IMG' && e.target.id.startsWith('img-')) {
      const imageId = e.target.id.replace('img-', '');
      selectImage(parseInt(imageId));
    }
  };
  
  editor.addEventListener('click', handleImageClick);
  
  return () => {
    editor.removeEventListener('click', handleImageClick);
  };
}, [selectImage]);
```

## Benefits of Event Delegation

1. **Persistence**: Event listener survives content updates
2. **Efficiency**: One listener instead of many
3. **Dynamic**: Works for images added at any time
4. **Clean**: Proper cleanup on unmount
5. **Reliable**: No race conditions with content updates
