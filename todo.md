# Fix Blog Widget Display Issue

## Problem Analysis
- [x] Identified duplicate onClick handlers in navigation buttons
- [x] First onClick sets isCreating=true, preventing proper navigation
- [x] localStorage sync happens in wrong onClick handler
- [x] Navigation to sections is broken due to conflicting handlers

## Solution Tasks
- [x] Remove the duplicate/incorrect onClick handler from navigation buttons
- [x] Keep only the proper onClick that calls setActiveSection
- [x] Move localStorage sync to the useEffect that monitors posts changes (already exists)
- [x] Test that navigation works correctly
- [x] Verify blog posts appear in widget after creating new posts
- [x] Create pull request with the fix

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Navigate between sections works correctly
- [x] Creating new blog posts saves to localStorage
- [x] Widget displays newly created posts
- [x] No console errors
