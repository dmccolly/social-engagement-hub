# Social Engagement Hub - Bug Fixes

## Current Issues (from user report)
- [ ] Posts aren't saving correctly
- [ ] Widget doesn't populate on home page
- [ ] Widget is embedded in the home page

## Investigation Steps
- [x] Clone repository and review structure
- [x] Identify React app with widget system
- [x] Check XANO service integration for post saving
- [x] Check localStorage persistence mechanism
- [x] Test widget data loading and display
- [x] Verify widget iframe communication
- [x] Check blog post creation/update workflow

## Root Cause Analysis - IDENTIFIED ISSUES
- [x] **ISSUE 1: Missing XANO_BASE_URL environment variable**
  - xanoService.js requires REACT_APP_XANO_BASE_URL
  - No .env file exists in repository
  - Posts fail to save to XANO backend
  - Falls back to localStorage only

- [x] **ISSUE 2: Widget localStorage sync works BUT...**
  - Main app syncs posts to localStorage correctly
  - Widget loads from localStorage as fallback
  - However, XANO is primary source and it's failing
  - Widget shows sample data when no real posts exist

- [x] **ISSUE 3: No error visibility to user**
  - XANO errors are logged to console only
  - User sees "Post saved successfully!" even when XANO fails
  - Misleading success message hides the real problem

## Fix Implementation
- [x] Create .env.example file with required variables
- [x] Create comprehensive BUGFIX_REPORT.md documentation
- [x] Create SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md for user guidance
- [x] Backup original xanoService.js
