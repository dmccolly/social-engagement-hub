# Critical Blog Editor Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Raw HTML Displayed Instead of Rendered Content ✅
**Problem**: Blog posts were displaying raw HTML code (`<br>`, `<p>`, `<span>` tags) instead of formatted content.

**Root Cause**: Multiple locations were using `{post.content}` which displays text literally instead of rendering HTML.

**Solution**: Changed all instances to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.content }}` to properly render HTML.

**Locations Fixed**:
- Line 608: News Feed posts
- Line 734: Calendar posts  
- Line 2598: Another post display
- Line 4034: Dashboard Featured Posts
- Line 4055: Dashboard Recent Posts

### Issue 2: Canvas Too Narrow ✅
**Problem**: The editor canvas was too narrow for comfortable editing.

**Solution**: Changed canvas width from `w-full` to `w-full max-w-6xl` to provide more editing space while maintaining responsiveness.

**Location**: Line 3443 - contentEditable div className

### Issue 3: Images Disappearing ✅
**Problem**: 
- When adding a second image, the first one disappears
- Both images disappear while editing
- Images lose their event handlers

**Root Cause**: 
The contentEditable div was using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: content }}` which caused the entire DOM to be replaced on every state update (every keystroke). This:
1. Removed all images from the DOM
2. Lost all event listeners attached to images
3. Caused images to disappear during editing

**Solution**:
1. Removed `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` from the contentEditable div
2. Added two useEffect hooks:
   - First useEffect: Sets initial content only once when component mounts
   - Second useEffect: Updates content only when editing an existing post
3. This prevents unnecessary DOM replacements during typing

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Removed this line:
dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: content || '<p>Start writing...</p>' }}

// Added these useEffects:
useEffect(() => {
  if (contentRef.current && !contentRef.current.innerHTML) {
    contentRef.current.innerHTML = content || '<p>Start writing...</p>';
  }
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  if (editingPost && contentRef.current) {
    contentRef.current.innerHTML = content || '<p>Start writing...</p>';
  }
}, [editingPost]);
```
