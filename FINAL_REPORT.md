This report details the comprehensive fixes and enhancements applied to the social engagement platform. The primary goal was to address critical issues, restore missing functionality, and improve the overall user experience. The project involved a complete overhaul of the main dashboard, news feed, blog editor, and widget system, resulting in a stable, feature-rich, and deployable application.

## 2. Summary of Fixes and Enhancements

### 2.1. Phase 2: Main Dashboard & News Feed Restoration

The initial phase focused on restoring core functionality to the main dashboard and news feed. This involved a complete rewrite of the main `App.js` component to integrate all the disparate features into a cohesive whole.

- **Dashboard Enhancements**: The main dashboard was restored to show comprehensive statistics, action buttons, and properly organized sections for featured and recent posts.
- **News Feed Restoration**: The news feed was brought back to life with full posting, liking, commenting, and reply functionality, creating an interactive community space.
- **Rich Text Editor Integration**: The advanced rich text editor was fully integrated, fixing the backwards typing issue and providing a complete set of formatting tools.

### 2.2. Phase 3: Enhanced Blog Widget Styling & Scrolling

This phase focused on improving the embeddable widgets to ensure they were both functional and visually appealing.

- **Blog Widget Improvements**: The blog widget was enhanced with a fixed height of ~400px per story, proper inner scrolling, transparent backgrounds, and optimized content display.
- **News Feed Widget Enhancements**: The news feed widget was updated with user avatars, a better visual hierarchy, and consistent styling to match the blog widget.
- **Responsive Design**: Both widgets were designed to be fully responsive and work seamlessly when embedded in external sites.

### 2.3. Phase 4: Enhanced Link Dialog & Image Controls

This phase addressed the usability of the rich text editor, focusing on the link dialog and image controls.

- **Link Dialog Improvements**: The link dialog was redesigned with a more professional UI, real-time validation, and a better user experience, including separate fields for "Text to Display" and "URL".
- **Image Controls System**: A complete image control system was implemented, allowing users to select, resize (small, medium, large), align (left, center, right), and remove images directly within the editor.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: The editor was improved with click-to-select for images, a floating control panel, and the ability to deselect images by clicking outside of them.

### 2.4. Phase 5: Enhanced Draft-to-Published Workflow

The final development phase focused on fixing the draft-to-published workflow, a critical component of the content management system.

- **Comprehensive Save System**: The save system was completely overhauled to handle all draft and publish states correctly, including creating, editing, and publishing posts.
- **Draft Management**: The system now fully supports creating, editing, publishing, and deleting drafts, with clear visual indicators for each state.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: The editor now includes status badges (PUBLISHED, DRAFT, FEATURED) and provides clear feedback for all actions.

## 3. Deployment

The enhanced social engagement platform was successfully deployed to production. The application was built using `react-scripts` and deployed as a static application. The final build is optimized for performance and ready for public use.

- **Framework**: React
- **Build Tool**: Create React App (`react-scripts`)
- **Deployment Environment**: Static hosting
