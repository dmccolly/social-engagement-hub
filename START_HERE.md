## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't have a XANO account?**
A: You'll need to set one up at https://xano.com to use the database features. The app will work with localStorage only, but data won't persist.

**Q: Do I need to change any code?**
A: No! Just add the environment variable and redeploy. That's it.

**Q: Will this break anything?**
A: No, it's backward compatible. The app will work better with XANO configured, but won't break without it.

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
A: Open browser console (F12) when creating a post. You should see "XANO response: ..." with data instead of errors.
