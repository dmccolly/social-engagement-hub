## Quick Setup for Xano AI

Copy this simplified prompt:

```
Create these 11 API endpoints for an email marketing system:

1. GET /email_contacts - return all contacts from email_contacts table, support query params: status, member_type, search
2. GET /email_contacts/{id} - return single contact by id
3. POST /email_contacts - create contact, inputs: email (required), first_name, last_name, status, member_type
4. PATCH /email_contacts/{id} - update contact, inputs: email, first_name, last_name, status, member_type
5. DELETE /email_contacts/{id} - delete contact by id

GROUP ENDPOINTS:
6. GET /email_groups - return all groups from email_groups table
7. GET /email_groups/{id} - return single group by id
8. POST /email_groups - create group, inputs: name (required), description

10. DELETE /email_groups/{id} - delete group by id
11. GET /email_groups/{group_id}/contacts - return all contacts in a group (join email_contacts with contact_groups table)

Enable CORS for all endpoints.
```

## After Creating Endpoints

1. **Test in Xano**: Use the API playground to test each endpoint
2. **Get API URL**: Copy your base URL from Xano settings
3. **Update App**: Add to `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_XANO_BASE_URL=https://your-workspace.xano.io/api:your-key
   ```
4. **Add CORS**: Add preview URL to Xano CORS settings:
   ```
   https://deploy-preview-15--gleaming-cendol-417bf3.netlify.app
   ```
