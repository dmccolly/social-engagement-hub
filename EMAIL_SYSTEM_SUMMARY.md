## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ Completed (100% Code Complete)
- All service functions written and ready
- All UI components created
- Test suite created and functional

### ⏳ Pending (Requires Xano Setup)
The code is complete, but you need to create the backend in Xano:

1. **3 Database Tables** to create
2. **13 API Endpoints** to create

## 🚀 How to Complete the Setup

### Step 1: Create Database Tables in Xano
Open `EMAIL_SYSTEM_SETUP.md` and follow the instructions to create:
1. `email_contacts` table
2. `email_groups` table
3. `email_group_contacts` table (junction table)

### Step 2: Create API Endpoints in Xano
Create all 13 endpoints as specified in `EMAIL_SYSTEM_SETUP.md`:
- 5 contact endpoints
- 5 group endpoints

### Step 3: Test Everything
Run the automated test suite:
```bash
cd social-engagement-hub
node test-email-functions.js
```

Expected result: All tests should pass ✅

### Step 4: Use the System
Once tests pass, you can:
- Access the email dashboard in your app
- Add contacts manually or import from CSV
- Create groups to organize contacts
- Send campaigns to specific groups
- Track engagement and statistics
