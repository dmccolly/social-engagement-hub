# Blog Post Persistence Fix

## Problem
Blog posts were only stored in React state (in-memory), so they vanished when:
- The app was restarted
- The browser was refreshed
- The browser was closed and reopened

## Root Cause
The posts state was initialized with hardcoded default values:
```javascript
const [posts, setPosts] = useState([
  { title: 'Welcome...', content: '...', ... },
  { title: 'Latest Updates...', content: '...', ... }
]);
```

While there was a useEffect that SAVED posts to localStorage, there was no code to LOAD posts FROM localStorage on initialization.

## Solution
Added a `loadPostsFromStorage()` function that:
1. Attempts to load posts from localStorage key 'socialHubPosts'
2. Validates that the data is an array with content
3. Returns the stored posts if found
4. Falls back to default posts if localStorage is empty or invalid

## Implementation
```javascript
const loadPostsFromStorage = () => {
  try {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem('socialHubPosts');
    if (stored) {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(stored);
      if (Array.isArray(parsed) && parsed.length > 0) {
        return parsed;
      }
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to load posts from localStorage', err);
  }
  
  // Return default posts if nothing in storage
  return [
    { title: 'Welcome to Our Platform', ... },
    { title: 'Latest Updates', ... }
  ];
};

const [posts, setPosts] = useState(loadPostsFromStorage());
```

## How It Works
1. **On App Start**: `loadPostsFromStorage()` is called to initialize state
2. **Loading**: Tries to load from localStorage
3. **Validation**: Checks if data is valid array
4. **Fallback**: Uses default posts if nothing found
5. **Saving**: Existing useEffect continues to save posts on changes
6. **Persistence**: Posts now survive page refreshes and browser restarts

## Testing
- ✅ Create a blog post
- ✅ Refresh the page → post persists
- ✅ Close and reopen browser → post persists
- ✅ Posts persist indefinitely until manually deleted
