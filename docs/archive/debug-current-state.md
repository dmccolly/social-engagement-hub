# Debug Current State

## Issues Identified

### 1. Toolbar Not Visible by Default
- Toolbar only shows when contentEditable div is focused
- This is by design (onFocus triggers showToolbar)
- User needs to click in the editor to see formatting buttons

### 2. Image Click Handler Issue
- We implemented event delegation in PR #4
- But user reports handles still don't appear when clicking images
- Need to verify:
  - Is event delegation working?
  - Is selectImage being called?
  - Are handles being created?
  - Are handles visible (z-index, positioning)?

### 3. Toolbar Class Mismatch
- onBlur looks for '.toolbar-area' class
- But toolbar div doesn't have this class
- This causes toolbar to hide when clicking toolbar buttons

## Next Steps
1. Add console logging to verify event delegation
2. Check if selectImage is being called
3. Verify handle creation and positioning
4. Fix toolbar class mismatch
5. Test complete flow: upload image → click image → see handles
