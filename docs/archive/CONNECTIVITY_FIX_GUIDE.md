# üîß Xano Connectivity Issue - Complete Fix Guide

## üö® The Real Problem

You're seeing **"Failed to save post. Saving locally instead."** because:

1. ‚úÖ **Data mapping is now fixed** (fields are correct)
2. ‚ùå **Environment variable is NOT configured** (Xano URL is undefined)

---

## üéØ Two-Part Solution

### Part 1: Data Mapping ‚úÖ FIXED
The code now sends all required fields to Xano. This was fixed in PR #13.

### Part 2: Environment Configuration ‚ùå NEEDS YOUR ACTION
You need to configure the Xano URL. **This requires your Xano credentials.**

---

## üöÄ Quick Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Xano URL

1. **Log into Xano**: https://xano.com/
2. **Go to your workspace**
3. **Click "API" in the left sidebar**
4. **Copy the Base URL** - it looks like:
   ```
   https://x8ki-letl-twmt.n7.xano.io/api:1
   ```

### Step 2: Configure for Netlify (Production)

Since your app is deployed at `https://gleaming-cendol-417bf1.netlify.app/`:

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Direct link: https://app.netlify.com/sites/gleaming-cendol-417bf1/settings/deploys#environment

2. **Add Environment Variable**:
   - Click "Add a variable" or "Edit variables"
   - **Key**: `REACT_APP_XANO_BASE_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Xano URL (from Step 1)
   - Click "Save"

3. **Redeploy**:
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy site"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

4. **Test**:
   - Visit your site: https://gleaming-cendol-417bf1.netlify.app/
   - Try creating a blog post
   - Should now save successfully!

### Step 3: Configure for Local Development (Optional)

If you want to test locally:

1. **Create `.env` file** in project root:
   ```bash
   cd social-engagement-hub
   nano .env
   ```

2. **Add this line** (replace with your actual URL):
   ```
   REACT_APP_XANO_BASE_URL=https://x8ki-letl-twmt.n7.xano.io/api:1
   ```

3. **Save and restart**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üîç Verification Steps

### Check 1: Environment Variable in Netlify

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/gleaming-cendol-417bf1/settings/deploys#environment
2. Look for `REACT_APP_XANO_BASE_URL`
3. Should show your Xano URL

### Check 2: Test on Live Site

1. Visit: https://gleaming-cendol-417bf1.netlify.app/
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Create a blog post
4. Look for these console logs:
   ```
   XANO_BASE_URL: https://x8ki-letl-twmt.n7.xano.io/api:1
   Creating blog post with data: {...}
   Sending to XANO: {...}
   Response status: 200
   ```

### Check 3: Verify in Xano

1. Log into Xano
2. Go to your database
3. Check the "asset" table
4. Your new blog post should appear there

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing "Saving locally instead"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Environment variable not set in Netlify
2. Site not redeployed after adding variable
3. Wrong Xano URL
4. Xano API not accessible

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Verify environment variable in Netlify
# Go to: Settings ‚Üí Environment variables

# 2. Trigger a new deploy
# Go to: Deploys ‚Üí Trigger deploy

# 3. Check browser console for actual error
# Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
```

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" or Network Error

**This means:**
- Environment variable IS set ‚úÖ
- But Xano API is not responding ‚ùå

**Check:**
1. Is your Xano URL correct?
2. Is the Xano API public or requires auth?
3. Test the URL in browser: `https://your-url.xano.io/api:1/asset`

### Issue: "404 Not Found"

**This means:**
- Xano URL is set ‚úÖ
- But endpoint doesn't exist ‚ùå

**Check:**
1. Does `/asset_create` endpoint exist in Xano?
2. Is it published?
3. Are you using the correct branch (`:1`, `:2`, etc.)?

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized"

**This means:**
- Xano requires authentication ‚ùå

**Solution:**
Add authentication in Netlify:
1. Add another variable: `REACT_APP_XANO_API_KEY`
2. Value: Your Xano API key
3. Redeploy

1. Your Xano base URL (from Xano dashboard)
2. Confirmation that you've added it to Netlify
