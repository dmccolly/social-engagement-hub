# Image Handling Functionality Restoration

## Summary
Successfully restored the drag-to-resize functionality for images in the blog post editor that was lost in newer iterations.

## Problem Identified
The current blog post editor (RichBlogEditor in App.js) had visual resize handles (corner dots) that appeared when selecting images, but these handles were non-functional. Users could not drag them to resize images interactively.

## Investigation
Found that the complete functionality existed in PatchedRichBlogEditor.js but was not included in the current implementation.

### Current Implementation (Before Fix)
- Had resize buttons (Small, Medium, Large, Full) - Working
- Had position buttons (Left, Center, Right) - Working  
- Created visual resize handles (corner dots) - Non-functional
- Handles had no event listeners attached
- Could not drag handles to resize images

### Reference Implementation (PatchedRichBlogEditor.js)
- Functional drag-to-resize handles with mousedown listeners
- Real-time resize with mouse drag tracking
- Updates toolbar position during resize
- Saves content after resize operation
- Proper event cleanup on mouseup

## Solution Implemented
Integrated the drag-to-resize functionality from PatchedRichBlogEditor.js into the current RichBlogEditor.

### Code Changes
**Location**: src/App.js, RichBlogEditor component, selectImage function (lines 2887-2980)

**Added**:
1. `handles` array to store handle references
2. `updatePositions()` function to reposition handles and toolbar during resize
3. `mousedown` event listener on each handle
4. `mousemove` handler for real-time resize tracking
5. `mouseup` handler for cleanup and content saving

### Key Features
- **Interactive Resize**: Drag corner handles to resize images in real-time
- **Smart Positioning**: Handles and toolbar automatically follow the image during resize
- **Content Persistence**: Content automatically saved after resize completes
- **Constraints**: Minimum width of 50px enforced
- **Smooth UX**: Real-time visual feedback during resize operation

## How to Use
1. Upload or insert an image into the blog post
2. Click on the image to select it (toolbar and corner handles appear)
3. Click and drag any corner handle (nw, ne, sw, se)
4. Image resizes smoothly as you drag
5. Release mouse button to complete resize
6. Content is automatically saved

## Technical Details

### Handle Creation
```javascript
handlePositions.forEach(pos => {
  const handle = document.createElement('div');
  // ... styling ...
  
  handle.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
    // Drag-to-resize logic
  });
  
  handles.push({ pos, el: handle });
});
```

### Resize Logic
- East handles (ne, se): Increase width when dragged right
- West handles (nw, sw): Decrease width when dragged left
- Width calculation: `newWidth = startWidth +/- dx`
- Minimum width enforced: `Math.max(newWidth, 50)`

### Position Updates
During resize, the `updatePositions()` function:
- Recalculates image bounding rectangle
- Updates each handle position based on corner
- Repositions toolbar above the image

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Handles appear when image is selected
- [x] Dragging east handles increases width
- [x] Dragging west handles decreases width  
- [x] Minimum width constraint works (50px)
- [x] Content saves after resize
- [x] Toolbar repositions during resize
- [x] Event listeners properly cleaned up
- [x] No console errors
