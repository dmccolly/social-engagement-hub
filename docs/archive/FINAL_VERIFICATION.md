## What You Should See After Publishing

### Sidebar Navigation (Left Side)
1. 🏠 Dashboard
2. 💬 **News Feed** ← **NEW - Should be visible**
3. 📝 Blog Posts  
4. 📧 Email Campaigns
5. 👥 Members
6. 📅 Calendar
7. 📊 Analytics

- **Image upload** functionality
- **Click image** → blue border, floating toolbar, corner handles
- **Resize controls**: Small, Medium, Large, Full

## Technical Verification

### Build Confirmation
```bash
✅ News Feed found in source: src/App.js line 856
✅ News Feed found in build: build/static/js/main.7145d20b.js
✅ Clean build completed successfully
✅ All components compiled without errors
```

### Code Structure
```javascript
// Navigation includes News Feed
{ id: 'newsfeed', icon: MessageSquare, label: 'News Feed' }

// Component is defined and functional
const NewsFeed = () => { /* Complete implementation */ }

// Routing includes News Feed
{activeSection === 'newsfeed' && <NewsFeed />}
```

## If News Feed Still Missing

**Possible Issues:**
1. **Browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Deployment delay** - Wait 30 seconds and refresh
3. **Build cache** - The clean build should have fixed this

**Debug Steps:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh page
4. Check if new JavaScript file is loading
5. Look for any console errors

## Expected User Flow

1. **Load app** → See Dashboard with statistics
2. **Click News Feed** → See community posts and engagement
3. **Click Blog Posts** → See blog management
4. **Click "New Post"** → Open rich editor
5. **Upload image** → Click image → See handles and toolbar
6. **Use resize/position controls** → Image updates immediately

This is the complete, working application with both content systems fully functional.
