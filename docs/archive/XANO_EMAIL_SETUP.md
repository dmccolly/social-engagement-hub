## üöÄ Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Tables
1. Log into Xano
2. Go to Database
3. Create each table listed above
4. Add all fields with correct types
5. Set up indexes

### Step 2: Create API Endpoints
1. Go to API section
2. Create each endpoint listed above
3. Connect to appropriate tables
4. Test endpoints in Xano

### Step 3: Test Endpoints
Use Xano's built-in API tester to verify:
- Can create contacts
- Can create groups
- Can add contacts to groups
- Can create campaigns

### Step 4: Get API URL
Copy your Xano API base URL:
```
https://xajo-bs7d-cagt.n7e.xano.io/api:pYeQctVX
```

## üìù Sample Data for Testing

### Sample Contacts
```json
[

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before proceeding with development:
- [ ] All 5 tables created
- [ ] All fields added with correct types
- [ ] Indexes created
- [ ] All 18 API endpoints created
- [ ] Endpoints tested in Xano
- [ ] Sample data added for testing
- [ ] API URL copied for use in app

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't create unique constraint on email
**Solution**: Make sure no duplicate emails exist before adding constraint

### Issue: Foreign key errors
**Solution**: Ensure referenced tables exist first (create email_contacts and email_groups before contact_groups)

### Issue: Endpoint returns empty
**Solution**: Check that table has data and query is correct

**Next Step**: Once Xano is set up, we'll integrate it with the React app!
