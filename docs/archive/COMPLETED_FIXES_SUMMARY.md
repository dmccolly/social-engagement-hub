# Completed Fixes Summary

## Session Overview
Successfully identified and fixed two critical issues in the Social Engagement Hub blog post editor.

---

## Fix #1: Blog Widget Display Issue ✅

### Problem
Blog posts created in the content creation area were not appearing in the widget iframe.

### Root Cause
Navigation buttons had duplicate onClick handlers that prevented proper section navigation and localStorage synchronization.

### Solution
Removed the duplicate onClick handler from navigation buttons, keeping only the proper `setActiveSection` handler.

### Pull Request
- **PR #2**: https://github.com/dmccolly/social-engagement-hub/pull/2
- **Status**: ✅ Merged and Deployed

### Impact
- Navigation between sections now works correctly
- Blog posts properly sync to localStorage
- Widget displays newly created posts as expected

---

## Fix #2: Image Drag-to-Resize Functionality ✅

### Problem
Image resize handles (corner dots) were purely decorative and non-functional. Users could not drag them to resize images.

### Root Cause
The current implementation created visual handles but didn't attach any event listeners. This functionality existed in `PatchedRichBlogEditor.js` but was lost in newer iterations.

### Solution
Restored the complete drag-to-resize functionality from `PatchedRichBlogEditor.js`:
- Added mousedown event listeners to handles
- Implemented real-time resize with mouse tracking
- Added updatePositions() function for handle/toolbar repositioning
- Automatic content saving after resize

### Pull Request
- **PR #3**: https://github.com/dmccolly/social-engagement-hub/pull/3
- **Status**: ✅ Merged and Deployed

### Impact
- Users can now drag corner handles to resize images
- Real-time visual feedback during resize
- Handles and toolbar follow the image smoothly
- Content automatically saved after resize
- Minimum width constraint (50px) enforced
