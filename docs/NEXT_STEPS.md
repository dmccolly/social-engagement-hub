## Before You Can Test üîß

The email system is deployed, but you need to set up the backend first:

### Step 1: Configure Xano CORS Settings

Add the preview URL to your Xano CORS allowed origins:

1. Log into your Xano workspace
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API Settings ‚Üí CORS
3. Add this URL to allowed origins:
   ```
   https://deploy-preview-15--gleaming-cendol-417bf3.netlify.app
   ```
4. Ensure these methods are enabled:
   - GET
   - POST
   - PATCH
   - DELETE
   - PUT
   - HEAD

### Step 2: Set Up Xano Database Tables

Follow the complete instructions in `XANO_EMAIL_SETUP.md`. You need to create:

**5 Tables:**
1. `email_contacts` - Store contact information
2. `email_groups` - Organize contacts into groups
3. `contact_groups` - Junction table for many-to-many relationships
4. `email_campaigns` - Store email campaigns
5. `campaign_sends` - Track individual email sends

**18 API Endpoints:**
- Contact Management (6 endpoints)
- Group Management (6 endpoints)
- Campaign Management (6 endpoints)

**Quick Setup Command** (if you have Xano CLI):
```bash
# Follow the detailed instructions in XANO_EMAIL_SETUP.md
```
