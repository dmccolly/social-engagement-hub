### Deployment Information

**Netlify Deployment:**
- Netlify automatically creates preview deployments for branches
- The preview URL format is typically: `https://deploy-preview-[PR-NUMBER]--[SITE-NAME].netlify.app`
- **However**: No Pull Request has been created yet, so no preview deployment exists

## Why No Deployment? ü§î

The branch exists on GitHub, but:
1. ‚ùå No Pull Request created
2. ‚ùå No preview deployment triggered
3. ‚ùå Code not merged to main branch

## Next Steps to Get Deployment üöÄ

### Option 1: Create Pull Request (Recommended)
This will trigger a Netlify preview deployment automatically:

```bash
gh pr create --base main --head feature/email-system \
  --title "Add Email Marketing System - Phase 1 (Contact Management)" \
  --body "Adds foundation for email marketing system with contact management interface"
```

### Option 2: Merge to Main
If you want to deploy to production immediately:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/email-system
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Manual Netlify Deploy
Deploy directly from the branch without PR:
- Go to Netlify dashboard
- Trigger manual deploy from `feature/email-system` branch

## What You Need to Do Before Testing üìã

Even after deployment, you need to:

1. **Set up Xano Database** (follow `XANO_EMAIL_SETUP.md`)
   - Create 5 tables
   - Create 18 API endpoints
   - Configure CORS settings

2. **Add Preview URL to Xano CORS**
   - Once PR is created, get the preview URL
   - Add it to Xano's allowed origins

3. **Test the Email System**
   - Navigate to `/email` route
   - Test contact management features
   - Verify Xano integration

## Current Blocker üöß

**The main issue**: No Pull Request = No Preview Deployment

Would you like me to:
- [ ] Create a Pull Request now?
- [ ] Merge to main branch?
- [ ] Wait for your decision?
