# üöÄ Final Setup Steps - Connect Your Xano Backend

## Step 1: Add Environment Variable to Netlify

Since the app is deployed on Netlify, you need to add your Xano API URL as an environment variable:

### Option A: Via Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site: **gleaming-cendol-417bf3**
3. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
4. Click **Add a variable**
5. Add:
   - **Key**: `REACT_APP_XANO_BASE_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Xano API URL (e.g., `https://xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.n7.xano.io/api:xxxxxxxx`)
6. Click **Save**
7. Go to **Deploys** ‚Üí Click **Trigger deploy** ‚Üí **Deploy site**

### Option B: Via Netlify CLI (Alternative)

If you have Netlify CLI installed:

```bash
netlify env:set REACT_APP_XANO_BASE_URL "https://your-xano-url.xano.io/api:your-key"
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Step 2: Verify CORS Settings in Xano

Make sure you've added these URLs to Xano CORS settings:

1. **Preview URL**: `https://deploy-preview-15--gleaming-cendol-417bf3.netlify.app`
2. **Production URL**: `https://gleaming-cendol-417bf3.netlify.app`

**In Xano:**
1. Go to **API** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **CORS**
2. Add both URLs to allowed origins
3. Enable all methods: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, PUT, HEAD
4. Click **Save**

---

## Step 3: Test the Connection

After Netlify redeploys (takes ~2-3 minutes):

1. Go to: https://deploy-preview-15--gleaming-cendol-417bf3.netlify.app/email
2. You should see the Email Dashboard
3. Click **Manage Contacts**
4. Try adding a test contact:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - First Name: Test
   - Last Name: User
   - Status: Subscribed
   - Member Type: Member
5. Click **Save**

**If it works**: ‚úÖ You'll see the contact in the list!

**If you see errors**: Check browser console (F12) for error messages

---

## Step 4: Verify Endpoints Are Working

Open browser console (F12) and check for:

‚úÖ **Success**: You'll see successful API calls
‚ùå **CORS Error**: Add preview URL to Xano CORS
‚ùå **404 Error**: Check endpoint names match exactly
‚ùå **Network Error**: Verify Xano API URL is correct

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch contacts"
**Solution**: 
- Verify environment variable is set in Netlify
- Trigger a new deploy after adding the variable
- Check Xano API URL is correct

### Issue: CORS Error
**Solution**:
- Add preview URL to Xano CORS settings
- Enable all HTTP methods
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: 404 Not Found
**Solution**:
- Verify endpoint names in Xano match exactly:
  - `/email_contacts` (not `/emailContacts`)
  - `/email_groups` (not `/emailGroups`)

### Issue: Empty Response
**Solution**:
- Check if Xano tables have data
- Test endpoints directly in Xano API playground
- Verify table names are correct
