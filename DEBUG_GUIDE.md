# Image Editor Debug Guide

## What I Fixed

The issue was that the floating toolbar and corner handles weren't appearing even though the blue border was working. I've made these key improvements:

### 1. Replaced Unreliable `onclick` Attributes
- **Before**: Used `onclick="window.functionName()"` in HTML strings
- **After**: Direct event listeners attached to buttons
- **Why**: More reliable, works better with React and modern browsers

### 2. Added Console Logging
- Click an image → Console shows "Image clicked, ID: [number]"
- Toolbar creation → Console shows "Toolbar created and added to body"
- Handle creation → Console shows "Added [position] handle"

### 3. Improved Toolbar Styling
- **Before**: Relied on CSS classes that might not load
- **After**: Inline styles to guarantee visibility
- **Result**: Toolbar should definitely appear with dark background

### 4. Better Handle Positioning
- **Before**: Relative positioning that could fail
- **After**: Fixed positioning with precise calculations
- **Result**: Blue corner handles should appear at exact image corners

## Testing Steps

1. **Publish the updated app**
2. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. **Upload an image**
4. **Click the image**
5. **Check console for messages**:
   - "Image clicked, ID: ..." ✅
   - "Found image element: [object]" ✅
   - "Added selected-image class" ✅
   - "Toolbar created and added to body" ✅
   - "Added nw handle", "Added ne handle", etc. ✅

## Expected Results

When you click an image, you should see:
- ✅ **Blue border** (you confirmed this works)
- ✅ **Dark floating toolbar** above the image with buttons: Small, Medium, Large, Full, |, ← Left, Center, Right →, ×
- ✅ **Four blue corner handles** at the image corners
- ✅ **Console messages** confirming each step worked

## If Still Not Working

If the toolbar/handles still don't appear:
1. **Check console messages** - which ones appear?
2. **Look for any error messages** in red
3. **Try refreshing the page** and testing again
4. **Report back** with the console output

The console logs will tell us exactly where the process is failing so I can fix it immediately.

## What Each Button Should Do

- **Small/Medium/Large/Full**: Resize the image
- **← Left**: Float image left with text wrapping
- **Center**: Center image with no text wrapping  
- **Right →**: Float image right with text wrapping
- **×**: Deselect image (remove border, toolbar, handles)

This debugging version should definitely work - the console logs will confirm every step is executing properly.
