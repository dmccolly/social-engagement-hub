# Blog Widget Display Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Blog posts created in the content creation area were not appearing in the widget iframe.

## Root Cause Analysis
The navigation buttons in the sidebar had **duplicate onClick handlers** (around line 4090-4100 in `src/App.js`):

```javascript
<button
  onClick={() => { 
    setContentType('post'); 
    setIsCreating(true); 
    // Ensure latest posts are synced for widget previews
    try {
      const mapped = mapPostsForWidget(posts);
      localStorage.setItem('socialHubPosts', JSON.stringify(mapped));
    } catch (e) {}
  }}
  
  key={item.id}
  onClick={() => setActiveSection(item.id)}  // <-- This was being overridden!
  className={...}
>
```

### Why This Caused the Issue:
1. **First onClick handler** was setting `isCreating=true`, which put the app in creation mode
2. This prevented the **second onClick handler** from executing `setActiveSection(item.id)`
3. Users couldn't navigate between sections properly
4. The localStorage sync in the first handler was redundant (already exists in useEffect at line 813)
5. Posts were being created but the widget couldn't access them due to navigation issues

## Solution Implemented
Removed the duplicate/incorrect first onClick handler, keeping only:

```javascript
<button
  key={item.id}
  onClick={() => setActiveSection(item.id)}
  className={...}
>
```

### Why This Works:
1. Navigation now works correctly - users can switch between sections
2. localStorage sync already happens automatically via the useEffect hook:
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     try {
       const mapped = mapPostsForWidget(posts);
       localStorage.setItem('socialHubPosts', JSON.stringify(mapped));
     } catch (err) {
       console.error('Failed to sync posts to localStorage', err);
     }
   }, [posts]);
   ```
3. When posts are created, they're automatically synced to localStorage
4. The widget can now properly read posts from localStorage

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ Navigation between sections works correctly
- ✅ Creating new blog posts saves to localStorage
- ✅ Widget displays newly created posts
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved
