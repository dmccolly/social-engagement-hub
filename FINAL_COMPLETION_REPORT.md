## 1. Introduction

This report details the successful completion of the requested enhancements to the social engagement platform.

All tasks have been completed as per the requirements, and the platform is now ready for review and testing.

## 2. Implemented Features

The following key features and improvements have been implemented:

### 2.1. New Calendar Widget

A fully functional calendar widget has been added to the platform. This widget allows users to view upcoming events and important dates in a clean and intuitive interface. The calendar widget includes the following features:

*   **Standalone Functionality:** The widget can be embedded on any website and functions independently of the main application.
*   **Customizable Settings:** Users can customize the widget's primary color, toggle the display of event times, and set the maximum number of events to display.
*   **Live Preview:** A live preview of the widget is available in the settings page, allowing users to see their customizations in real-time.
*   **Embeddable Code:** The platform generates an iframe embed code for easy integration into any website.

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standalone URL**   | `/widget/calendar`                                                          |

| **Embed Code**       | Generates an iframe code for easy embedding                                 |

### 2.2. Settings Page Reorganization

The settings page has been reorganized to improve user experience and navigation. The "Settings" link is no longer a top-level navigation item but is now located under the "Calendar" section in the sidebar. This change provides a more logical and hierarchical structure to the platform's navigation.

**Old Navigation Structure:**

*   Dashboard
*   News Feed
*   Blog Posts
*   Email Campaigns
*   Members
*   Calendar
*   **Settings**
*   Analytics

**New Navigation Structure:**

*   Dashboard
*   News Feed
*   Blog Posts
*   Email Campaigns
*   Members
*   Calendar
    *   **Settings**
*   Analytics

### 2.3. Blog Widget Functionality

The blog widget was reviewed and tested to ensure it only displays blog posts, not the entire social hub. The widget is functioning correctly and as per the requirements.

## 3. Deployment and Testing

All changes were implemented on a separate feature branch to avoid any disruption to the stable main branch. The application was successfully built and deployed to a temporary server for testing. All new features and changes have been verified to work correctly.

## 4. Conclusion

The requested enhancements to the social engagement platform have been successfully implemented, tested, and deployed. The new calendar widget provides valuable functionality, and the reorganized settings page improves the overall user experience. The platform remains stable and all changes are ready for final review and merging into the main branch.
